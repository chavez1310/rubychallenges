			<h4>Do it, then redo it!</h4>
			<p>When you first begin to learn how to program, you will likely run into some difficulties at some point, everyone does. The thing to remember is that the answer exists, you just have to search for it, and once you've found it, make sure you re-do it over and over again. </p>

			<p>Wax on, wax off, wax on, wax off. Repetition is key, I suggest you do things at least three times over, so you can remember your steps more easily.</p>

			<h4>Trust your headed in the right direction.</h4>
			<p>Whenever you are trying to learn a new skill, it isn't uncommon for you to feel some doubt. The material gets challenging, you get tired, and you get stuck, this shouldn't deter you though, as you will soon find that the better you get at figuring stuff out, the less time you'll spend being stuck.</p>

			<p>You will not only learn a new language, but you will learn to be a problem solver.</p>
